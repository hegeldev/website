Welcome to Hegel! This page will orient first-time Hegel users and direct you to next steps.

Hegel exists because of a problem: writing a good property-based testing (PBT) library is hard. Writing a good PBT library in *every language*? Even more so.

To help address this problem, many of the hardest parts of writing a PBT library can, in principle, be reused. Bug-finding distributions, automatic shrinking, and flexible generator primitives could all be written once and used in every language. This would lower the barrier to entry and make world-class property-based testing available to all languages, in a way which simply wasn't feasible before.

<!-- consolidate the best of property-based testing in every language. -->

Hegel accomplishes exactly that.

Hegel is several things. It is a protocol for communicating between a PBT server (written once) and a PBT library (written for each language). It is also an implementation of this server and libraries in a number of languages.

When we say "Hegel", we might mean any or all of these things. Your interest in Hegel will therefore determine which you might want to read further about:

- Want to *use* Hegel? [hegel-rust](https://github.com/hegeldev/hegel-rust), [hegel-go](https://github.com/hegeldev/hegel-go), [hegel-cpp](https://github.com/hegeldev/hegel-cpp), [hegel-typescript](https://github.com/hegeldev/hegel-typescript), and [hegel-java](https://github.com/hegeldev/hegel-java) are fully-fledged property-based testing libraries, built on Hegel.
